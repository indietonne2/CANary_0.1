## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Logging
- Centralized via `LoggingSystem`.
- Components send structured log messages to LoggingSystem.
- Log levels: INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG.

### Error Handling
- Errors captured by `ErrorManager`.
- Standardized error propagation and handling strategy across modules.

### Security
- Managed via `AccessControl`.
- User roles and permissions enforced consistently across GUI and CLI.
- Sensitive data encrypted within SQLiteDB.
